## Project Summary
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of handwritten digit recognition using the popular MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a classic machine learning problem, and this project serves as a practical example of building and training a CNN for image classification.

## Key Features
Utilizes the Keras library to create a CNN model for image classification.
Preprocesses the MNIST dataset, including one-hot encoding of labels and data normalization.
Implements convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers in the CNN architecture.
Trains the model on the MNIST training dataset and evaluates its performance on the test dataset.
Computes a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance on multi-class classification.
Calculates the overall accuracy as a key evaluation metric.
## Getting Started
To run this project on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed, including Keras and scikit-learn.
3. Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it.
4. Train the CNN model and evaluate its performance.
5. Model Evaluation
The project includes a model evaluation step where you can assess the performance of the CNN on the MNIST test dataset. The accuracy and confusion matrix are computed to provide insights into the model's classification abilities.

## Future Improvements
This project can be extended and improved in several ways:

* Experiment with different CNN architectures to achieve better accuracy.
* Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
* Explore hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
* Visualize the model's predictions on new, user-provided handwritten digits.
Feel free to contribute to the project or use it as a foundation for your own image classification tasks.
